# Continuous Ethylene Plant Performance Diagnosis

## Project Overview

This project analyses six months of operational data from a continuous ethane cracking process producing ethylene.

The objective was to:

- Define baseline plant performance
- Quantify production losses due to downtime and fouling
- Evaluate temperature–conversion trade-offs
- Recommend data-driven operational improvements

The analysis was conducted from the perspective of a process engineer responsible for diagnosing plant underperformance.
